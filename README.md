## To do

* Fix kernel panic on sleep wake

* https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/near-perfect-high-sierra-setup-on-z77x-ud5h-ivy-bridge-i5-rx-560.252663/

## Sleep/Wake

* Disable hibernate
    * sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
    * sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
* Wake causes: https://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-find-system-wake-causes-in-os-x/
* syslog | grep Wake
* log show --style syslog | fgrep "Wake reason"
* Turns out random wakes during the night was due to power nap. Disabled power nap in system preferences and appears to have solved the issue
* Serial Port must be disabled in the BIOS [Source](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/339369-wake-issues-since-catalina/?tab=comments#comment-2691528), without this a KP when resuming from sleep will occur.

```
jq -r 'map(.timestamp | match("\\d+\\-\\d+\\-\\d+\\s+\\d+:\\d+") | .string ) | .[]' | uniq

log show --start "2019-05-02 12:00:00" --end "2019-05-02 18:00:00"  --style json | jq -r 'map(.timestamp | match("\\d+\\-\\d+\\-\\d+\\s+\\d+:\\d+") | .string ) | .[]' | uniq
```

## Post Setup Checks

Things to check post-setup/upgrade

* Check TRIM is enabled on all drives
* Ensure CPU power management is working correctly
* Check USB Mapping is correct in IOReg/IORegistryExplorer

## Bootloader

OpenCore used as boot loader (Clover replacement). Bootloader config is revisioned via git: https://gitlab.com/nickw444/opencore-efi (this repo)

### Audio ðŸ“£

Works OOB with [AppleALC](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/) using `inject=5`

### USB

USBInjectAll to customize port mapping. USB3 "working" out of the box.

USB3 front panel connector does not able to be able to keep USB3 HDD connected for any meaningful amount of time. Possibly an issue with power?

Used [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap) to generate an injector kext to remove UIA, however this motherboard has some funky internal hub setup, and I couldn't change the injected hub ports with this kext. Instead had to use a [customized DSDT](resources/DSDT/SSDT-UAIC.dsl)

USB Map plist for USBMap tool can be found in [resources/USBMap/USB.plist](resources/USBMap/USB.plist).


#### Port Mapping

**Front Panel**

From left to right:

* P1: (Spliced internally, used for BT Controller - see below)
    * USB2: HS01 (routed via XHC controller)
    * USB3: SS01
* P2:
    * USB2: HS02 (routed via XHC controller)
    * USB3: SS02
* P3:
    * USB2: PR11 (Internal hub), HP15
* P3:
    * USB2: PR11 (Internal hub), HP16

**Back Panel**

From top to bottom, left to right

* P1:
    * USB2: PR21 (Internal hub), HP26
* P2:
    * USB2: PR21 (Internal hub), HP25
* P3:
    * USB2: PR21 (Internal hub), HP24
    * USB3: SS03
* P4:
    * USB2: PR21 (Internal hub), HP23
    * USB3: SS04

### Bluetooth / WiFi w/ Broadcom Card

BCM943602CS: 802.11ac 3x3, (1.3Gbps / 5GHz) + Bluetooth 4.1. The module will be applied in MacBook Pro computers (2015)

* BCM43602 14e4:43ba supported in 3.17+ (brcmfmac)
* BCM43602 14e4:43bb 2.4GHz device, supported in 3.19+
* BCM43602 14e4:43bc 5GHz device, supported in 3.19+


Bluetooth USB connection must be connected to XHC bus and marked as internal (DSDT type 255), otherwise this will cause random wake as soon as machine goes to sleep. Recall all USB ports on the back panel are routed via EH02 via a hub, so we cannot use that, and instead must splice the internal USB ([source](https://github.com/al3xtjames/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-macOS-Install/issues/65#issuecomment-312686694))

> What worked for me in the same fenvi is making sure that the connector type for the internal usb header is set to internal port. I used fbpatcher to do it. [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/ayou5v/fenvi_fvt919_bluetooth_not_working/ei2nymc/)

Previously used a USB3 20 pin splitter to splice, but this caused issue with USB detection from the FP ports. Instead a splice was made directly in the cable from the case. May need to "unsplice" if a replacement mobo has better internal USB support.

**Bluetooth Firmware Issues**

This didn't seem necessary for getting BT support for Catalina, however I recall that once the firmware is loaded once the issue goes away. The issue may re-appear when returning back from Windows (which clobbers the firmware)

Add device ID so the firmware is loaded at boot ([Source](https://github.com/the-darkvoid/BrcmPatchRAM/issues/35)):

```xml
        <key>0a5c_21ff</key>

> The thing I'd check is the Vendor and drvice IDs to ensure they're exactly right. For the BCM94360CD (the three-antenna for WiFi, one antenna for BT4.0 design), the Bluetooth controller needs to be 05ac:828d and the WiFi needs to be 106b:0111 (those are technically sub vendor and device IDs, I guess because the main vendor and device IDs of 14e4:43a0 refer to the underlying Broadcom chip itself). Apparently there are other Broadcom 4360 chipset-based cards with different sub product IDs like 0136 that get sold and aren't the exact right models and thus don't wind up unlocking every feature properly.

> Fenvi T-919 is the easy answer, itâ€™s a Broadcom BCM94360-based card that should support native functionality in macOS. You will need a driver for it for Windows. You could also get an adapter and an Apple official BCM94360 card (a 2-antenna -CS or -CS2 from a MacBook Air, or a 4-antenna -CD from an iMac) and just use the Bootcamp drivers in Windows (not sure about Linux, sorry).

**Handoff Stopped Working**

> Log in and out of icloud on all your devices. After that, wait a couple hours / days and literally do nothing, it'll start working out of thin air. Happened to countless users including me with a native Fenvi t919.
